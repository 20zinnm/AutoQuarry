# AutoQuarry

> Automated quarries for the industrial Minecrafter.

## Usage

To construct a quarry, place four iron bars in the sides of a 3x3 square. In the middle (touching all four bars), place a dispenser. The dispenser should be converted into a quarry.

Using a quarry is easy; just load fuel using a hopper and then press start in the menu.
